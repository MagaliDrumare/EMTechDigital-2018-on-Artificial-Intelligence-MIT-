Video 12/ Future Focus: Quantum Computing in Next Generation AI Research
by Dario Gil, IBM Research
https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/dario-gil-quantum-computing/

Main ideas : 
-> What are the impact of Quantum AI Networks?  
-> QBit : one and a zero at the same time 
_>Unlike classical computers, which store information in bits that are either 1 or 0, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states of 1 and 0 at the same time—a phenomenon known as “superposition.” 
-> Qubits can also influence one another even when they’re not physically connected, via a process known as “entanglement.”
->IBM’s team first ran the task on a quantum machine without entangling the qubits, which produced an error rate of 5 percent. The second time around it ran the same experiment with the qubits entangled, which produced an error rate of just 2.5 percent.

Video 13 / Adversarial Machine Learning
by Ian Goodfellow, Google Brain
https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/ian-goodfellow-gans/

Main ideas : 
-> Generative adversarial networks used to create realistic image. 
-> Based on game theory: Descrimator tries to make the generative image fake, the Generator want to fool the descriminator into thinking image is real. At convergence the genetator will produce images that look like realistics. 
-> Use GAN as a classifier by devided real things (descriminator) into class of small categories: real cat/ real dog/ fake. 
-> Use GAN for simulation : simulating particle physics (CERN). 
-> Use GAN for simulated training data (Apple eye's detector).
-> Use GAN for driving car to create day and night photos (Nvidia). 
-> Use GAN as component of optimization algorithm (new DNA sequences). 
-> Privacy of training data by limiting the number of data used to train the model. 
-> Training on Adversarial example : Train= Adv, Test=Clean do better than Train= Clean, Test = Clean. 
-> Hight challenge : secure machine learning.
