Video 12/ Future Focus: Quantum Computing in Next Generation AI Research
by Dario Gil, IBM Research
https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/dario-gil-quantum-computing/

Main ideas : 
-> What are the impact of Quantum AI Networks?  
-> QBit : one and a zero at the same time 
->Unlike classical computers, which store information in bits that are either 1 or 0, quantum computers use qubits, 
which can exist in multiple states of 1 and 0 at the same time—a phenomenon known as “superposition.” 
-> Qubits can also influence one another even when they’re not physically connected, via a process known as “entanglement.”
->IBM’s team first ran the task on a quantum machine without entangling the qubits, which produced an error rate of 5 percent. The second time around it ran the same experiment with the qubits entangled, which produced an error rate of just 2.5 percent.
